- **Added Chunked Caching** for large city datasets to handle **database cache driver** more effectively.
    - Divided the caching process into smaller chunks to avoid exceeding MySQLâ€™s packet size.
    - Introduced `cacheInChunks()` to store the cities data in smaller parts and retrieve them efficiently.
    - This change ensures that caching large city data in the database cache driver doesn't lead to the "MySQL server has gone away" error.
- **Performance Improvement**: Optimized city data retrieval by caching in chunks and merging data from multiple chunks.
- **Database Cache Driver Compatibility**: The chunked caching strategy now ensures compatibility with the database cache driver (`CACHE_DRIVER=database`), preventing large cache payload issues.
